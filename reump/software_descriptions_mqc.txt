    <dd>Test whether human milk is different from bovine milk in terms of metabolites</dd>
    <dt>Hierarcical Clustering</dt>
    <dd>This shows top 50 (ranked by two-sample t-test p-value from lowest to highest) significant metabolites that make bovine milk different from bovine milk. If the metabolite has a match in SECIM library, the name will show on the plot, otherwise it would be an unknown metabolite</dd>
    <dt>Bar Plot</dt>
    <dd>This shows top 10 matched metabolites with a significant p-value and with the most positive/negative fold change</dd>
    <dt>Venn Diagram</dt>
    <dd>It shows the overlap and difference between the two materials</dd>
