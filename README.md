Arguments (it is mandatory to change `input_file` and `mzmine_dir` before running:
----------------------------- common parameters ----------------------------------
    --input_dir_pos                         folder location for positive data, default is 'data/POS'
    --input_dir_neg                         folder location for positive data, default is 'data/NEG'
    --POS_design_path                       location for positive design file, default is 'data/pos_design.csv'
    --NEG_design_path                       location for negative design file, default is 'data/neg_design.csv'
    --cutoff                                cutoff p-value for mummichog pathway analysis, default is 0.05
    --unknown_search                        whether do unknown search for unidentified metabolites or not, default is '0', please set it to '1' when needed
    --version                               whether to show version information or not, default is null
    --help                                  whether to show help information or not, default is null
Please refer to nextflow.config for more options.

Container:
    Docker image to use with -with-docker|-with-singularity options is
    'docker://xinsongdu/lemaslab_rump:v0.0.0'

RUMP supports .mzXML format files.
```

## Components

RUMP accepts `.mzXML` and `.mzXL` files. Files are processed in parallel using [MZmine-2.53](http://mzmine.github.io/); several statists are calculated using [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) codes; interactive report is generated with [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/); pathway analysis are done with [mummichog](http://mummichog.org/); unknown metabolites search are done with [CEU Mass Mediator](https://github.com/lzyacht/cmmr). Note that the processes related to unknow search with CEU Mass Mediator is turned off by default due to the unstable server, it can be turned on by setting parameter `--unknown_search` to "1".

## Currently included statistical analysis

-   *Student t-test*: Test if there is a significant statistical difference of certain peak intensities between the two groups of samples.
-   *Venn diagram*: Report the number of peaks that are significantly enriched in one of the groups, and the number of peaks that have no significant difference between two groups.
-   *Principal component analysis*: Dimensional reduction using the peak intensities of the two group samples, and visualize the difference.
-   *Hierarchical clustering*: Cluster all samples and plot a heatmap to show the difference between samples and peaks.
-   *Bar plot*: plot the metabolites with top-10 and bottom-10 fold-change for the comparison between two groups. (note: the figure will display abnormally if there is an infinite fold change value)

## Logging

Logs and error reports will be stored under `logs/` folder after running.

## Clean repository

Run the following command to clean all the files generated by Nextflow
```
bash clear.sh
```

## Exit status values

RUMP returns the following exit status values:
-   3: Positive file groups are not the same as negative file groups, please check design files.
-   4: Not all input files are in .mzXML format, please check input data folders.
-   5: One or more input files does not exist.
-   Other Linux reserved exit codes: https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html
