## Licence

This program is released as open source software under the terms of [GNU GPL-v3.0 License](https://github.com/GalaxyDream/RUMP/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Usage

Please refer to our [wiki](https://github.com/lemaslab/RUMP/wiki) for how to install and use RUMP

## Help message

RUMP can display usage information on the command line:

```bash
Nextflow main.nf --help true
```

## Components

RUMP accepts `.mzXML` and `.mzXL` files. Files are processed in parallel using [MZmine-2.53](http://mzmine.github.io/); several statists are calculated using [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) codes; interactive report is generated with [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/); pathway analysis are done with [mummichog](http://mummichog.org/); unknown metabolites search are done with [CEU Mass Mediator](https://github.com/lzyacht/cmmr). Note that the processes related to unknow search with CEU Mass Mediator is turned off by default due to the unstable server, it can be turned on by setting parameter `--unknown_search` to "1".

## Currently included statistical analysis

- *Student t-test*: Test if there is a significant statistical difference of certain peak intensities between the two groups of samples.
- *Venn diagram*: Report the number of peaks that are significantly enriched in one of the groups, and the number of peaks that have no significant difference between two groups.
- *Principal component analysis*: Dimensional reduction using the peak intensities of the two group samples, and visualize the difference.
- *Hierarchical clustering*: Cluster all samples and plot a heatmap to show the difference between samples and peaks.
- *Bar plot*: plot the metabolites with top-10 and bottom-10 fold-change for the comparison between two groups. (note: the figure will display abnormally if there is an infinite fold change value)

## Logging

Logs and error reports will be stored under `logs/` folder after running.

## Clean repository

Run the following command to clean all the files generated by Nextflow

```bash
bash clear.sh
```

## Exit status values

RUMP returns the following exit status values:

- 3: Positive file groups are not the same as negative file groups, please check design files.
- 4: Not all input files are in .mzXML format, please check input data folders.
- 5: One or more input files does not exist.
- [Other Linux reserved exit codes](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html)
